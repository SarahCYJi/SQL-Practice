Schema:
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Name varchar(255), Department varchar(255), ManagerId int);
Truncate table Employee;
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('101', 'John', 'A', 'None');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('102', 'Dan', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('103', 'James', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('104', 'Amy', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('105', 'Anne', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('106', 'Ron', 'B', '101');


The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. 
Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John 	  |A 	      |null      |
|102   |Dan 	  |A 	      |101       |
|103   |James 	|A 	      |101       |
|104   |Amy 	  |A 	      |101       |
|105   |Anne 	  |A 	      |101       |
|106   |Ron 	  |B 	      |101       |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:

+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+
Note:
No one would report to himself.


Solutionï¼š

SELECT b.Name
FROM
(SELECT ManagerId
FROM Employee
GROUP BY ManagerId 
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Id) >=5) AS a
INNER JOIN Employee b
ON a.ManagerId = b.Id;



Note:
This is a very good example to show the performance of SQL code. Try to work out other solutions and you may be surprised by running time difference.
If your solution uses 'IN' function and runs more than 5 seconds, try to optimize it by using 'JOIN' instead.
