Table: Players

+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| player_id   | int   |
| group_id    | int   |
+-------------+-------+
player_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the group of each player.
Table: Matches

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| match_id      | int     |
| first_player  | int     |
| second_player | int     | 
| first_score   | int     |
| second_score  | int     |
+---------------+---------+
match_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row is a record of a match, first_player and second_player contain the player_id of each match.
first_score and second_score contain the number of points of the first_player and second_player respectively.
You may assume that, in each match, players belongs to the same group.
 

The winner in each group is the player who scored the maximum total points within the group. In the case of a tie, the lowest player_id wins.

Write an SQL query to find the winner in each group.

The query result format is in the following example:

Players table:
+-----------+------------+
| player_id | group_id   |
+-----------+------------+
| 15        | 1          |
| 25        | 1          |
| 30        | 1          |
| 45        | 1          |
| 10        | 2          |
| 35        | 2          |
| 50        | 2          |
| 20        | 3          |
| 40        | 3          |
+-----------+------------+

Matches table:
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| match_id   | first_player | second_player | first_score | second_score |
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| 1          | 15           | 45            | 3           | 0            |
| 2          | 30           | 25            | 1           | 2            |
| 3          | 30           | 15            | 2           | 0            |

| 5          | 35           | 50            | 1           | 1            |
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+------------+
| group_id  | player_id  |
+-----------+------------+ 
| 1         | 15         |
| 2         | 35         |

Solution:
SELECT      d.group_id,
            d.player_id
FROM    
(SELECT      *,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY c.group_id ORDER BY total_score DESC, c.player_id) AS ranking
FROM        
(SELECT      a.group_id,
            a.player_id,
            SUM(score) AS total_score
FROM        Players a
LEFT JOIN   
(SELECT     first_player AS player_id, first_score AS score
FROM        Matches
UNION ALL   
SELECT      second_player AS player_id, second_score AS score
FROM        Matches) AS b
ON          a.player_id =b.player_id
GROUP BY    a.group_id,
            a.player_id) AS c) AS d
WHERE       ranking = 1
