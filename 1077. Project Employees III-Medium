+-------------+---------+
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key to Employee table.
Table: Employee

employee_id is the primary key of this table.
 

Write an SQL query that reports the most experienced employees in each project. In case of a tie, report all employees with the maximum number of experience years.

The query result format is in the following example:

Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+

Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 3                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+

Result table:
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | employee_id   |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 1             |
| 1           | 3             |
| 2           | 1             |
+-------------+---------------+
Both employees with id 1 and 3 have the most experience among the employees of the first project. For the second project, the employee with id 1 has the most experience.

Solution:
SELECT project_id, employee_id
FROM 
(SELECT a.*, b.experience_years, 
        MAX(b.experience_years) OVER(PARTITION BY a.project_id) AS max_exp
FROM Project a
LEFT JOIN Employee b
ON a.employee_id = b.employee_id) AS a
WHERE experience_years = max_exp;
