### SQL Schema
Create table If Not Exists Weather (Id int, RecordDate date, Temperature int)
Truncate table Weather
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('1', '2015-01-01', '10')
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('2', '2015-01-02', '25')
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('3', '2015-01-03', '20')
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('4', '2015-01-04', '30')

Given a Weather table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.

+---------+------------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | RecordDate(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
|       1 |       2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 |       2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 |       2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 |       2015-01-04 |               30 |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
For example, return the following Ids for the above Weather table:

+----+
| Id |
+----+
|  2 |
|  4 |
+----+

Solution:
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT W.Id AS "Id"
FROM   Weather 
INNER JOIN Weather AS W
ON   DATEDIFF(day, Weather.RecordDate, W.RecordDate)=1 
AND W.Temperature > Weather.Temperature


Takeaway:
You can join two tables on conditions not limited to TableA.X=TableB.X.
This provides an idea on comparing the value to today and next day.
DATEDIFF(datepart, startdate, enddate)
