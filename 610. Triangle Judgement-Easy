SQL Schema:
Create table If Not Exists triangle (x int, y int, z int)
Truncate table triangle
insert into triangle (x, y, z) values ('13', '15', '30')
insert into triangle (x, y, z) values ('10', '20', '15')


A pupil Tim gets homework to identify whether three line segments could possibly form a triangle.
 

However, this assignment is very heavy because there are hundreds of records to calculate.
 

Could you help Tim by writing a query to judge whether these three sides can form a triangle, assuming table triangle holds the length of the three sides x, y and z.
 

| x  | y  | z  |
|----|----|----|
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
For the sample data above, your query should return the follow result:
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
|----|----|----|----------|
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |

Solution:
SELECT *,
    CASE WHEN x+y >z AND x+z >y AND y+z >x AND ABS(x-y)<z AND  ABS(x-z)<y AND ABS(y-z)<x THEN "Yes"
    ELSE "No" END AS triangle
FROM triangle; 

IN FACT:
SELECT *,
    CASE WHEN x+y >z AND x+z >y AND y+z >x THEN "Yes"
    ELSE "No" END AS triangle
FROM triangle; 
IS ENOUGH
because x+y >z  =   x> z-y
