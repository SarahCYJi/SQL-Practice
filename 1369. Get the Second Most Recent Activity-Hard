SQL Schema:
Create table If Not Exists UserActivity (username varchar(30), activity varchar(30), startDate date, endDate date);
Truncate table UserActivity;
insert into UserActivity (username, activity, startDate, endDate) values ('Alice', 'Travel', '2020-02-12', '2020-02-20');
insert into UserActivity (username, activity, startDate, endDate) values ('Alice', 'Dancing', '2020-02-21', '2020-02-23');
insert into UserActivity (username, activity, startDate, endDate) values ('Alice', 'Travel', '2020-02-24', '2020-02-28');
insert into UserActivity (username, activity, startDate, endDate) values ('Bob', 'Travel', '2020-02-11', '2020-02-18');


Table: UserActivity
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| username      | varchar |
| activity      | varchar |
| startDate     | Date    |
| endDate       | Date    |
+---------------+---------+
This table does not contain primary key.
This table contain information about the activity performed of each user in a period of time.
A person with username performed a activity from startDate to endDate.

Write an SQL query to show the second most recent activity of each user.
If the user only has one activity, return that one.
A user can't perform more than one activity at the same time. Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example:

UserActivity table:
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| username   | activity     | startDate   | endDate     |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Alice      | Travel       | 2020-02-12  | 2020-02-20  |
| Alice      | Dancing      | 2020-02-21  | 2020-02-23  |
| Alice      | Travel       | 2020-02-24  | 2020-02-28  |
| Bob        | Travel       | 2020-02-11  | 2020-02-18  |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| username   | activity     | startDate   | endDate     |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Alice      | Dancing      | 2020-02-21  | 2020-02-23  |
| Bob        | Travel       | 2020-02-11  | 2020-02-18  |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+

The most recent activity of Alice is Travel from 2020-02-24 to 2020-02-28, before that she was dancing from 2020-02-21 to 2020-02-23.
Bob only has one record, we just take that one.


Solution:
SELECT   	username,activity,startDate,endDate
FROM 
(SELECT    *,
         CASE WHEN MAX(ranking) OVER(PARTITION BY username) >=2 THEN ranking ELSE 2 END AS final_ranking
FROM
(SELECT    *, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY username ORDER BY endDate DESC) AS ranking 
FROM      UserActivity) AS a) As b
WHERE    final_ranking =2;


Takeaway:
1. WHERE executes before SELECT 
2. You can use window function in case when

SELECT   	username,activity,startDate,endDate
FROM 
(SELECT 	*,
         CASE WHEN max_ranking >= 2 Then ranking ELSE 2 END AS final_ranking
FROM
(SELECT    *,
         MAX(ranking) OVER(PARTITION BY username) AS max_ranking
FROM
(SELECT    *, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY username ORDER BY endDate DESC) AS ranking 
FROM      UserActivity) AS a) as b) as c
WHERE    final_ranking =2;
